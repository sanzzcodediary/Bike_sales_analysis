# 🚲 Bike Sales Dashboard (Excel)

This project analyzes bike purchasing behavior using a dataset from a European sales context. The data includes demographic, occupational, and regional details of potential buyers.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

An interactive Excel dashboard was created using pivot tables and charts to highlight key insights about bike buyers and non-buyers.

### Visualizations Included:
- **Average Income by Gender and Purchase Status**  
  Compares income levels of male and female buyers vs. non-buyers.
  
- **Age Bracket of Bike Owners**  
  Shows the age distribution of customers who purchased bikes, segmented by life stage (adults, older working population, senior citizens).

- **Commute Distance vs. Bike Ownership**  
  Explores how commuting distance impacts the likelihood of owning a bike.

### Interactive Filters:
- Region (Europe, North America, Pacific)
- Occupation
- Education Level
- Marital Status

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Dashboarding)
- Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Descriptive Analytics

## 📁 Files Included

- `Bike_Sales_Dashboard.xlsx` – Excel file containing the full dashboard, raw data, and pivot tables
- `README.md` – Project summary and instructions

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Bike owners generally have higher average incomes than non-owners.
- The older working population is the most likely age bracket to purchase a bike.
- People commuting shorter distances (0–1 miles) are more likely to own bikes.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add data slices by number of children or car ownership.
- Export charts to Power BI for more interactive visuals.
- Include trend analysis over time (if timestamps available in data).
